# CIRRUS workshop: start here

You are inside a container running on a Kubernetes cluster, with a terminal, an
editor, and the tools to talk to that cluster as *yourself*. Nothing here is a
simulation — the commands on these pages act on a real cluster, in a namespace
that belongs to you.

These pages are meant to be read in order the first time and used as a reference
afterwards.

---

## Three things first

Do these before anything else. Each of the later pages assumes they worked.

### 1. Open a terminal

* **JupyterLab** — *File → New → Terminal*, or the `+` launcher, then *Terminal*.
* **VS Code** — *Terminal → New Terminal*, or `Ctrl`+`` ` ``.

### 2. Sign in to the cluster

Your first `kubectl` command triggers a sign-in. Run it in the terminal, not in
a notebook — the prompt has nowhere to appear inside a kernel and will simply
time out.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

It prints something like:

```
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin
and enter the code XXXXXXXXX to authenticate.
```

Open that URL in a **new browser tab**, enter the code, and finish the sign-in
with your normal NCAR credentials. There is no browser inside this container,
which is why it hands you a code instead of opening one for you.

The command then completes. The token is cached for about an hour, so the next
`kubectl` will not ask again. When it expires you sign in once more — see
[Troubleshooting](99-troubleshooting.ipynb#i-am-asked-to-sign-in-again) for why
there is no silent refresh.

### 3. Check the session

```bash
cirrus-check
```

Twenty checks: is there a session kubeconfig, is it pointed at the workshop
cluster and *your* namespace, is your home directory being kept out of harm's
way, can a token be obtained, does an authorized call come back. Every line
should say `PASS`. If any say `FAIL`, the message names what to fix — and
[Troubleshooting](99-troubleshooting.ipynb) covers the ones that come up.

---

## The pages

Eleven notebooks, in the order the work actually happens. They are yours to run
and scribble in: once you have run one it is kept across sessions rather than
replaced from the image.

### Start here — the platform, and the four things it is built on

| | lesson | what it covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Orientation](01-orientation.ipynb) | What CIRRUS is, the two sites, when to use it instead of Casper or Derecho, how to get access, and what comes with it |
| 2 | [Containers](02-containers.ipynb) | What a container actually is, how to build one, and the registry that holds it — including CVE scans and SBOMs |
| 3 | [Kubernetes](03-kubernetes.ipynb) | `kubectl` and your namespace; Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingresses, ConfigMaps, PVCs — written and applied by hand |
| 4 | [Helm](04-helm.ipynb) | Packaging those manifests into something installable, configurable and reviewable |
| 5 | [Argo CD](05-argocd.ipynb) | GitOps: the cluster pulling its own desired state from a repository, and how an application gets onboarded here |

Pages 1 through 5 build on each other, and the application you deploy by hand in
lesson 3 is the one you package in lesson 4 and hand to Argo CD in lesson 5. If
you read nothing else, read these.

### Then — the platform services every real application needs

| | lesson | what it covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | [Secret Manager](06-secrets.ipynb) | OpenBao: where credentials live, and how they reach a pod without ever touching git |
| 7 | [Storage](07-storage.ipynb) | PVCs and storage classes, GLADE, and the on-site S3 |
| 8 | [GitHub Actions](08-github-actions.ipynb) | Runner scale sets on cluster hardware, building images without a Docker daemon, and CI security |
| 9 | [Observability](09-observability.ipynb) | Finding your logs and metrics in Grafana, and alerting on your own application |
| 10 | [Specialized workloads](10-workloads.ipynb) | Jupyter, functions as a service, MPI, and the LLM service |
| — | [Troubleshooting](99-troubleshooting.ipynb) | The failures people actually hit here |

Pages 6 to 10 are reference material rather than walkthroughs — a web UI, a
ticket, or a manifest you commit rather than a command you type — so they are
mostly prose, with few or no cells to run. Read the one you need when you need
it; each is self-contained. Troubleshooting is a lookup table.

### Running them

Sign in from a **terminal** first (`kubectl get pods`) and complete the
device-code prompt. A credential prompt cannot be shown inside a kernel, so the
first `kubectl` in a notebook will only time out. You will need to do it again
roughly hourly, when the token expires.

Then run the setup cell at the top, once — it sets the working directory and
`$IMG` in the kernel, which every `%%bash` cell inherits. A handful of steps are
terminal-only by nature — an interactive shell, watching two things at once —
and appear as plain code blocks rather than runnable cells.

If you would rather read a lesson than run it, `cirrus-intro 3` pages it in a
terminal, and `jupyter nbconvert --to markdown 03-kubernetes.ipynb` writes it out
as a Markdown file you can keep.

---

## Where things live

| path | what it is | survives the session? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `~/cirrus-intro/` | your working directory — the editor opens here | **yes**, it is on your GLADE home |
| `~/cirrus-intro/README.md` | this page | replaced from the image every launch |
| `~/cirrus-intro/` | the lessons | notebooks you have run are kept; untouched ones refresh every launch |
| `/tmp/cirrus/` | caches, tokens, editor state | no, it is the pod's own disk |
| `/opt/cirrus/` | the read-only bits the image ships | it is the image |

Two consequences worth internalising:

**Put your work in `~/cirrus-intro/`, not outside the lesson files.** This page is
replaced from the image at every launch — that is how you get corrections without
re-copying anything — so it is read-only, and your editor will refuse to save
over it rather than let you lose an edit. The lessons are the exception: once you
have run a notebook it is yours, and it is kept across launches instead of being
replaced. Any *other* file you leave in `cirrus-intro/` is gone next session.
Everything else in `~/cirrus-intro/` is yours and persists.

**Your home directory is shared with Casper and Derecho.** This session
deliberately writes almost nothing to it: caches, Python packages and editor
state all go to `/tmp/cirrus/` instead. A wheel built inside this container and
installed into `~/.local` can break your HPC logins outright — different glibc,
different CPU features. If you `pip install` something here, it lands in the
session, not in your home, and it is gone next launch. That is intentional.

---

## What is installed

```bash
cirrus-versions          # every pinned tool and its version
cirrus-versions --check  # re-run each one and diff against the pin
```

The short list: `kubectl`, `helm`, `argocd`, `stern`, `kubelogin`, `yq`, `jq`,
`git`, plus Python with `kubernetes` and `pyyaml`. Nothing is `latest` — a
session that worked at the last workshop works at the next one.

`kubectl`, `helm`, `argocd` and `stern` have tab completion in `bash` and `zsh`,
and `k` is an alias for `kubectl` with completion wired to it too:

```bash
k get po        # same as kubectl get pods
k get <TAB>     # completes resource types
```

`tcsh` gets the alias and the environment but no completion — those tools only
publish `bash` and `zsh` completions.

---

## Reading these pages

They are Markdown, and they are set up to open **rendered** rather than as
source in both editors.

* **JupyterLab** — this page opened on launch; links between pages open in a new
  tab. To see the raw Markdown: right-click the file in the browser → *Open With*
  → *Editor*.
* **VS Code** — this page opened as the folder's README; links between pages open
  in the same preview. To see the raw Markdown: right-click the file → *Open
  With…* → *Text Editor*.

From a terminal, in any editor:

```bash
cirrus-intro          # list the lessons
cirrus-intro 2        # read lesson 2 in the pager
```

(That reads the Markdown edition — a notebook is not much use in a pager.)

---

## Going further

These pages are an introduction: enough of each idea to use it, and enough
vocabulary to read the real documentation. When you want a full hands-on
workshop on one of them, these are the CIRRUS ones, and they fit together:

| workshop | what it adds |
| --- | --- |
| [nbviz-to-container](https://github.com/NicholasCote/nbviz-to-container) | takes a Jupyter notebook visualisation and turns it into a containerised web server — the natural sequel to [page 2](02-containers.ipynb), and the one to do first if containers are the new part |
| [k8s-argo-codespace](https://github.com/NicholasCote/k8s-argo-codespace) | Argo CD end to end against a real Flask application and Helm chart: install it, deploy through it, change a value in git and watch it sync, then break the image tag and watch it hold |
| [gitops-harbor-workshop](https://github.com/NicholasCote/gitops-harbor-workshop) | the CI half — GitHub Actions building an image, a Harbor robot account, pushing to `hub.k8s.ucar.edu`, and Argo CD picking it up |

Each runs in a GitHub Codespace with its own cluster, so you can work through
them without needing CIRRUS access.

And one repository that is not a workshop but is the thing you will actually copy
from: **[NCAR/cirrus-examples](https://github.com/NCAR/cirrus-examples)** — the
platform's own Helm charts for a web application, a service, Ceph and NFS
volumes, PostgreSQL, Dask, OpenBao secrets and Prometheus alerts. Every page from
6 onwards points at one of them.

## Getting help

* `cirrus-check` first, always. It turns "Kubernetes is broken" into a line
  naming what is wrong.
* [Troubleshooting](99-troubleshooting.ipynb) for the specific failures this
  environment produces.
* NCAR HPC documentation:
  <https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute-systems/cirrus/>
* The CIRRUS site — status, applications, architecture, and the request forms:
  <https://cirrus.k8s.ucar.edu/>
* A ticket, for anything that needs the team: the *New Service Request* and
  *Report Issue* forms linked from that site, or <cirrus-admin@ucar.edu>.
* At a live workshop: ask. That is what the room is for.
